      <h2> What It Is</h2>
    <p>NoteWriter is a ground-breaking solution to one of healthcare's most prevalent problems: writing notes.</p>
    <p>Healthcare providers today spend 45% of their time using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). A significant portion of that time is spent documenting
      interactions with patients into notes.
    </p>
    <p>NoteWriter uses Artificial Intelligence to simplify and automate specific parts of the documentation process, saving hours of valuable time for you and your team. </p>

<p>Our technology accurately captures the relevant medical details from each patient visit. Using customizable templates,
  those details are rapidly written into a note that can easily be edited and uploaded to any EHR.</p>
  <p>With NoteWriter, you can focus on your patients and leave the (medical) details to us.</p>
