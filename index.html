  </div>
  <p>NoteWriter is a simple solution to a complex problem.</p>
  <p>Our technology is designed to accurately capture the relevant details from each patient visit. Using a customizable template,
    that information is rapidly filled in to a note that you can easily edit and add to your current EHR.</p>
  <p>With NoteWriter, you can listen more to your patients and less on writing a note.</p>
