    <h2>Our Story </h2>
    <section id="introduction">
      <p>As our founder, Boston, was finishing medical school, he was shocked at how much time doctors were required
        to spend on their computers. Years of study, work, and sacrifice to learn how to heal people and keep them healthy,
        just to spend 45% of your work day sitting in front of a computer screen. 
      </p>
      <p>Our team realized the potential of AI to fix this problem early in 2023. Trial and error led to a working prototype
        that impressed all of the doctors and residents that Boston showed it to. Believing this could be an early,
        simple, transformational application of AI, our team went all in. Since then we have worked tirelessly to create a product
        that, we believe, will revolutionze the healthcare industry, one note at a time.
